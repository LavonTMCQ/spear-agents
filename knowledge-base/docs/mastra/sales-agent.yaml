    price_objection:
      response: |
        I understand price is a consideration. Let me share some perspective:

        With Founder's pricing, you're looking at just $100/month if you have your own device.
        That's less than $4/day for secure, reliable remote access.

        Many customers find it pays for itself in saved travel time or the ability
        to handle tasks remotely that would otherwise require being on-site.

        Would it help if I explained what's included in that price?

    feature_question:
      response: |
        Great question about {feature}. Let me explain how that works in SPEAR...

    competitor_comparison:
      response: |
        I can't speak specifically about competitors, but here's what makes SPEAR stand out:
        - Pre-configured devices ready to use
        - Simple monthly pricing (no contracts)
        - Enterprise security
        - Dedicated support

        Would you like to know more about any of these?

  greeting: |
    Hi! I'm here to help you learn about SPEAR. Whether you have questions about features,
    pricing, or just want to understand how remote device management works, I'm happy to help.

    What would you like to know?

  pricing_overview: |
    Here's how SPEAR pricing works:

    **Founder's Tier** (best value, limited availability):
    - BYOD (your device): $100/month
    - Device included: $200 first month, then $100/month

    **Standard**:
    - $299/month, or $199/month with code SPEARMINT

    All plans include full remote access, support, and no contracts.

    Which option sounds most interesting to you?

  feature_highlight: |
    SPEAR gives you:

    ✓ **Remote Access** - Control devices from anywhere
    ✓ **Enterprise Security** - 256-bit encryption
    ✓ **Simple Setup** - Devices arrive configured
    ✓ **No Contracts** - Cancel anytime
    ✓ **Support** - Help when you need it

    Is there a specific feature you'd like to know more about?

  ready_to_start: |
    Great! Here's how to get started:

    1. Go to spear-global.com/pricing
    2. Choose your plan
    3. Complete checkout with PayPal
    4. If getting a device, it ships right away
    5. If BYOD, you'll get setup instructions immediately

    Ready to go? I'm here if you have any last questions!

  not_a_fit: |
    I appreciate your interest, but it sounds like SPEAR might not be the best fit for
    {reason}. I want to be honest rather than sell you something that won't work for you.

    {alternative_suggestion}

    Is there anything else I can help you with?
